## 🎯 For Claude Code Agents

Each audit file contains:
- **Vulnerability Description** - Detailed explanation of security issues
- **Risk Assessment** - Severity rating and potential impact
- **Affected Components** - Specific files and code locations
- **Remediation Steps** - Exact code changes needed
- **Verification Method** - How to test the fix
- **Agent Assignment** - Which Claude Code agent should handle it

## 🔍 Audit Methodology

Our security audit covered:
- **Authentication & Authorization** - JWT implementation, session management
- **Input Validation** - API endpoints, file uploads, user inputs
- **Data Protection** - Encryption, secrets management, PII handling
- **Infrastructure Security** - CORS, headers, Docker configuration
- **Client-Side Security** - XSS prevention, token storage, API calls

## 📊 Overall Security Status

| Component | Issues Found | Critical | High | Medium | Low |
|-----------|--------------|----------|------|--------|-----|
| Backend Authentication | 8 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| API Endpoints | 12 | 2 | 4 | 4 | 2 |
| Database Security | 6 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| Frontend Security | 9 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 2 |
| Infrastructure | 7 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 1 |
| **Total** | **42** | **9** | **13** | **13** | **7** |

## 🚨 Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **Unencrypted AWS Credentials Storage** - `backend/database.md`
2. **Weak JWT Secret Validation** - `backend/authentication.md`
3. **Missing Token Revocation** - `backend/authentication.md`
4. **CORS Production Vulnerability** - `infrastructure/cors-configuration.md`
5. **SQL Injection Risk** - `backend/api-endpoints.md`

## 🎯 Agent Work Assignment

### security-sweeper
- Focus on `remediation-plans/critical-fixes.md`
- Implement immediate security patches
- Validate security improvements

### backend-fastapi-refactorer  
- Address all issues in `backend/` directory
- Focus on API security and database protection
- Implement proper input validation

### frontend-react-refactorer
- Handle all issues in `frontend/` directory  
- Fix token storage and XSS prevention
- Secure API client implementation

### langchef-refactor-architect
- Coordinate security improvements across components
- Ensure security architecture consistency
- Plan phased remediation approach

## 📈 Progress Tracking

Each audit file includes a progress section:
- ❌ **Not Started** - Issue identified but not addressed
- 🔄 **In Progress** - Agent actively working on fix
- ✅ **Completed** - Issue resolved and verified
- 🔍 **Under Review** - Fix implemented, awaiting validation

## 🔗 Integration with Development Workflow

1. **Before Development** - Review relevant audit files
2. **During Implementation** - Follow remediation steps
3. **After Changes** - Update progress status
4. **Testing** - Use verification methods provided
5. **Documentation** - Update security notes in code

## 📞 Escalation Process

For complex security issues:
1. Consult `remediation-plans/implementation-guide.md`
2. Check with langchef-refactor-architect for architectural guidance
3. Refer to security best practices in `/docs/security/`
4. Update this documentation with lessons learned
