# LangChef Product Context

## Context
As organizations continue to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into their systems, there's a critical need for a robust platform that supports the entire LLM development lifecycle. LangChef addresses this need by providing an end-to-end solution for prompt design, dataset management, experimentation, and analysis.

### Core Workflow
The LangChef platform follows a structured workflow as illustrated in the sequence diagram:

1. **Prompt Design**: Create and iterate on prompts that can be tested across multiple LLM models and datasets
2. **Dataset Management**: Prepare and store labeled datasets for experimentation
3. **Experimentation**: Run prompts against datasets using various model configurations (temperature, top_p, top_k)
4. **Results & Benchmarking**: Collect, store, and analyze experiment results
5. **Refinement Loop**: Use insights from results to refine prompts or select different LLM models
6. **Agent Creation**: Build visual agent flows to deploy optimized prompts as functional agents with tools

### Objectives
- Centralize prompt management and versioning
- Support dataset creation, labeling, and curation
- Enable structured experimentation across multiple model versions, parameters, and datasets
- Provide robust analysis and reporting capabilities
- Facilitate continuous improvement through feedback loops
- Offer low-code agent building and deployment capabilities

## User Personas & Use Cases

### ML Researcher/Data Scientist
- Needs a single platform to iterate on prompts, compare model versions, and track performance metrics
- Designs prompts and tests them across different models and configurations
- Manages dataset labeling, curation, and versioning
- Analyzes experiment results to refine approaches

### DevOps / SRE
- Monitors experiment performance and investigates errors during model rollout
- Tracks resource usage and costs across experiments

### Application Developer
- Creates LLM agents using optimized prompts
- Needs simple integration of LLMs into applications
- Requires production-ready API endpoints for agents
- Wants low-code solutions for agent creation
