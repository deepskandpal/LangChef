## Agent Flow Builder Implementation

### Frontend Components
- **AgentFlowCanvas**: Main React component that orchestrates the entire flow builder UI
  - Implements drag-and-drop functionality for adding components to the canvas
  - Handles node connections, selection, and property updates
  - Provides save, test, and deploy functionality
  
- **Node Components**:
  - **LLMNode**: Visual representation for Language Model nodes with customizable properties
  - **SearchToolNode**: Visual representation for Search Tool nodes with engine and result count configuration
  
- **UI Panels**:
  - **ComponentPanel**: Side panel with draggable components to add to the canvas
  - **PropertiesPanel**: Contextual property editor for selected nodes
  - **TestingConsole**: Interactive console for testing agent flows with real-time results

### Backend Implementation
- **AgentFlow Model**: Data structure for representing agent flows
  - Supports nodes, edges, and metadata
  - Includes validation and API endpoint generation
  - Methods for updating, publishing, and testing flows
  
- **API Routes**:
  - CRUD operations for agent flows
  - Special endpoints for publishing, testing, and deploying flows
  
- **Flow Execution Controller**:
  - Handles the runtime execution of agent flows
  - Processes nodes in sequence following the flow graph
  - Manages context passing between nodes

### Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation created in `docs/agent-flow-builder.md`
- Covers features, components, getting started guide, and best practices

### Current Limitations
- Limited set of available node types (currently only LLM and Search Tool)
- Basic flow execution logic (no support for complex branching or error handling)
- In-memory storage for flows (should be moved to a database in production)
- Mock implementations for LLM and search tool functionality

### Next Steps
1. Add more tool types (e.g., code execution, retrieval from vector DB)
2. Implement persistent storage for flows using a database
3. Add support for branching logic and conditional execution
4. Integrate with the existing prompt management system
5. Implement proper deployment as production-ready API endpoints

## Upcoming Milestones
1. **Complete Sequence Diagram Core Flow**
   - Target: Fully functional workflow from prompt design to result analysis
   - Timeline: 2-3 weeks

2. **Enhanced Benchmarking Tools**
   - Target: Comprehensive tools for comparing experiments and refining prompts
   - Timeline: 4-5 weeks

3. **Advanced Dataset Management**
   - Target: Improved labeling, versioning, and golden dataset creation
   - Timeline: 4-5 weeks

4. **Agent Flow Builder MVP**
   - Target: Functional visual agent builder with LLM and search tool components
   - Timeline: 3-4 weeks
   - Dependencies: LLM Integration component

## Success Metrics
- Complete implementation of sequence diagram workflow
- Effective prompt refinement based on experimental results
- Comprehensive benchmarking across different LLM models and configurations
- User-friendly interface for the entire LLM development lifecycle
- Seamless integration of agent building capabilities within the LangChef ecosystem
