# LangChef Project Brief

## Project Overview
LangChef is a robust platform supporting the entire Large Language Model (LLM) development lifecycleâ€”from prompt design and dataset management to comprehensive experimentation and analysis. The platform centralizes workflows, accelerates innovation, and ensures consistent model performance as organizations integrate LLMs into their systems.

## Core Components (Aligned with Sequence Diagram)
- **Prompt Management**: Design, versioning, and storage of prompts
- **Dataset Management**: Labeled dataset creation, storage, and versioning
- **LLM Integration**: Support for multiple LLM providers with configurable parameters (temperature, top_p, top_k)
- **Experimentation Framework**: Run experiments across prompts, models, and datasets
- **Results & Benchmarking**: Track experiment results and use them for prompt refinement or LLM upgrades
- **Agent Flow Builder**: Visual interface for creating and deploying LLM agents with tools

## Project Goals
1. Centralize prompt management and versioning.
2. Support dataset creation, labeling, curation, and versioning.
3. Enable structured experimentation across multiple LLM models, parameters, and datasets.
4. Provide robust analysis, visualization, and reporting capabilities.
5. Facilitate feedback loops for prompt refinement and model improvement.
6. Enable low-code agent creation and deployment through visual interfaces.

## Success Criteria
- Functional platform covering the entire LLM experiment workflow.
- Centralized repository for prompts, datasets, and experiment results.
- Demonstrable improvement in LLM development iteration speed.
- Reliable tracking of experiments, configurations, and results.
- Effective mechanisms for using results to refine prompts or evaluate model changes.
- Intuitive visual interface for building and deploying LLM agents.

## Timeline
